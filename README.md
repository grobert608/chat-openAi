# Cool chat with OpenAI
> The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language, code, or images.

This application is a unique combination of a chatbot and a 3D modeling tool, which provides users with an interactive experience. The chatbot serves as an AI assistant, capable of answering questions, assisting with tasks, and providing helpful information to the user. The AI assistant is designed to have a natural language processing capability, which enables it to understand and respond to the user's queries and requests in a conversational manner.
